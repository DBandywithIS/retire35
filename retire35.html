    <h2>Dedication</h2>
      <p> In 10 seasons, Howard started more than 60% of all Red Wings regular season games. From the '09-'10 season to the '18-'19 season, the stallward goalie played over 50 games in 7 different seasons, including his first two years when he started over 60 games.</p>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <p>A jersey typically isn't retired based on games played alone, otherwise the Illitch family would have needed more rafters in the new LCA. Here's a short list of statistics that help solidify Howard's place among the long list of great goaltenders that have worn the Winged Wheel.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shots faced - 1st (15313)</li>
          <li>Saves made - 1st (13970)</li>
          <li>Save % (gp 200+) - 1st (.912)</li>
          <li>GAA (gp 200+) - 3rd (2.62)</li>
          <li>Games played - 3rd (543)</li>
          <li>Games started - 2nd (518)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Jimmy's Place in History</h2>
      <p> As you can see, Jimmy Howard shares the top 3 in virtually every statistical category with Terry Sawchuk, whose number 1 currently hangs in the rafters at LCA, and Chris Osgood (why Osgood's number 30 isn't retired yet is beyond me).</p>
      <p>The Detroit Red Wings' 100th anniversery is right around the corner. Terry Sawchuk is universally credited as being one of the greatest goaltenders of all time. Jimmy Howard has eclipsed many statistical feats that only Sawchuk achieved with the Red Wings. I could think of no better way for the Wings to celebrate their centenial than to honor Jimmy Howard by raising the number 35 into the rafters in Little Caeser's Arena.</p>
